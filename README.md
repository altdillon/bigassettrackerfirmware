Firmware for the hardware portion of the big asset tracker senior desing project at CU Denver.  
The goal of this project is to build a tracking device that will be about the size of a standerd brick.  This device will contain a pic microcontroller, an LTE device, and a 6 amp hour battery.  The firmware for the microcontroller is this repo.
